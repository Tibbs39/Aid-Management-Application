# Aid Management Application

This project is an application that manages the list of goods that need to be shipped to a disaster area.
The client application tracks the quantity of items needed, tracks the quantity on hand, and stores information
in a file for future use.

There are two types of goods that need to be shipped.
  - Perishable products, items that would have an expiry date, such as some foods, and medicine
  - Non-perishable products, items which have no expiry date, such as blankets and tents.

A polymorphic class was used to distinguish between perishable and non-perishable products. The classes can be added to an inventory system and can be logged for future reference.
