# Aid-Management-Application
##Final Project of OOP244 of Winter 2018 from Seneca College

This project is an application that manages the list of goods that need to be shipped to a disaster area.
The client application tracks the quantity of items needed, tracks the quantity on hand, and stores information
in a file for future use.

There are two types of goods that need to be shipped.
  - Perishable products, items that would have an expiry date, such as some foods, and medicine
  - Non-perishable products, items which have no expiry date, such as blankets and tents.

In this assignment we used the iProduct interface to access the Product class. The Perishable class is a child of the Product class.
